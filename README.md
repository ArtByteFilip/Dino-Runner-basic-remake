# Dino-Runner-basic-remake

Don't expect too much from it. It's just a cube that jumps over larger rectangles. Later I added artificial intelligence to the code that could jump based on some simple methods without losing score but it was so hacked that after each jump the browser chopped like 10 times more. So I rather removed it. :D
